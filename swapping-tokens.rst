Swapping tokens using AMMs
==========================

- In DeFi token trading typically happens using automated market maker (AMMs)
- An AMM is a series of decentralized smart contracts that cannot be shut down
- In centralized exchanges trades happen using an order book
- In a decentralized exchange (dex) trades happen using a formula where each trade affects the price of a token automatically
- AMM internals are discussed in greater depth at a later time

Making a trade
==============
1. Go to `Sushiswap <https://app.sushi.com/swap>`_
2. Select the token you want to swap from (or leave the token on ETH)
3. Select the token you want to swap to. Select USDC for example (see notes)
4. Enter an amount to swap
5. Hit "Swap"
6. Hit "Confirm Swap"
7. Hit "Confirm" in Metamask
8. Wait for the transaction to complete (this can take anywhere between 5 seconds to several minutes depending on network congestion)
9. Add the "to" token in Metmask by clicking "Assets" then "Add Token"
10. Confirm your wallet balances have updated correctly

.. note:: USDC is a stablecoin. A stablecoin is a token whose price is pegged to the dollar (or euro).

.. note:: If you are swapping ETH make sure not to swap all of your ETH. You need ETH to make transactions.
